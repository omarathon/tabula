/**
 * Contains the main API methods that can be called from Session.
 *
 * About IDs
 * ---------
 *
 * In Turnitin, classes and assignments can have two kinds of ID. They always have an internally
 * generated ID which is returned in a response, but it's also possible to pass your own external ID
 * when creating the object. The API will never expose this back to you, but it is stored with the object
 * so you can later refer to it by that ID.
 *
 * I think when we use a ClassId or AssignmentId, we should use our own values.
 *
 * About creating objects
 * ----------------------
 *
 * For many of the APIs, if you make a request as a user who doesn't already exist, they will be created
 * (though the login step will do this anyway). If you create an assignment referring to a class ID that
 * doesn't exist, the class will be created implicitly. the same goes for the paper submission, which can
 * implicitly create both a class and an assignment for you. So you can avoid a few API calls by skipping
 * the step of making those things explicitly.
 *
