/**
 * Applying this trait to an object signifies that it fulfils a contract for
 * being a target for permissions checking. Roles can grant permissions against
 * objects of this type, or a parent of this object.
 *
 * For example, Assignment may extend PermissionsTarget. A role may grant the
 * permission Assignment.Delete() either directly to the Assignment, or to the
 * module in which the Assignment contains. Permissions checking code can therefore
 * check against the Assignment itself, or (iteratively) against its permissions
 * container.
 *
 * If this object is at the top of its permissions tree (for example, a Department)
 * then permissionsParents should return an empty Seq().
