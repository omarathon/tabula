/**
 * Thrown by security when a user tries to do an action that
 * they don't have permission to do. The app should handle
 * this exception specially and return a generic page (or perhaps
 * a more specific explanation page for certain situations).
 *
 * It shouldn't generally be possible to get this exception by
 * clicking in the UI. You'd only get this by trying to manually
 * go to a different department's URL, for example, or using a
 * bookmarked link to a department who you've since been removed from.
 *
 * Is a RuntimeException because we don't expect the app to need
 * to declare that this is thrown.
