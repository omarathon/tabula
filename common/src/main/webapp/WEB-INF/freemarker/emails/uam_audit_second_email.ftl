For the Tabula audit of user access permissions, we have not yet received confirmations from all the User Access Managers (UAMs).

If you have not yet done so, to satisfy data audit requirements, please complete the Tabula User Audit form here:

${url}

Here is a list of departments and sub-departments that you should check:

<#list departments as department>${department.departmentName} - https://tabula.warwick.ac.uk${department.permissionTreeUrl} <#if department_has_next>

</#if></#list>

- Ensure that staff in your department have the appropriate permission levels.
- Ensure that only those staff necessary have permission to view students’ personal information.
- In accepting the UAM role, you agree that you are responsible for the accuracy of these permissions - and will monitor permissions periodically. If you are unable to monitor permissions in the future, you should request that the UAM role is assigned to another person within your department.

Please be aware that, should we not receive a response, due to the audit implications we will need to remove your User Access Manager permissions and ask the Head of Department to select a new User Access Manager. For audit purposes, this must be done by ${permissionConfirmation}.

Thanks for your assistance in this matter.
