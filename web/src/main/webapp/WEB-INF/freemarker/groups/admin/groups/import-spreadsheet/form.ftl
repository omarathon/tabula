<p>You can create and edit sets of small groups, their groups and events by uploading a spreadsheet.
	Note that the spreadsheet must be in the correct format, for this reason we suggest you
	<a href="<@routes.groups.import_spreadsheet_template department academicYear />">download a template spreadsheet</a> that contains all the current groups for this year, and use that
	to create your spreadsheet.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
	<p>You can add extra sheets to the template and upload it, but you must upload a
		spreadsheet with three sheets: "Sets", "Groups" and "Events" in the same format as the template, and
		they must include the columns in the template (though you can add extra columns if you want, they'll be ignored).</p>
