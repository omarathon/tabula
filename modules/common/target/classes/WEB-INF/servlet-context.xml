		This is intentionally left blank. The servlet context is a child context of the main application context
		and I can't think of any reason, given that we only initialise the application as a web application,
		that we'd want to put anything in here at the moment, particularly since the web and api modules are
		separate. By having this blank, we can pass this to the DispatcherServlet and avoid initialising everything
		twice, which is bad m'kay.

		Basically if you put anything in here, you're going to have to try very hard to justify it.
